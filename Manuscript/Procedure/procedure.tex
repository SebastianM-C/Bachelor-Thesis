\section{The Hamiltonian}

In this chapter we will describe how we obtained the numerical results.
We begin by computing the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian in a basis
given by the eigenstates of an isotropic double harmonic oscillator.
In analogy with the classical case, we consider two independent
quantum numbers \(n_1, n_2\) corresponding to the two orthogonal
oscillating directions. We can define two number operators \(N_1, N_2\) such that
\(N_1 \ket{n_1, n_2} = n_1 \ket{n_1, n_2}\) and \(N_2 \ket{n_1, n_2} = n_2 \ket{n_1, n_2}\).
We consider the creation and annihilation operators \(\ad{1}, a_1\) and
\(\ad{2}, a_2\)
such that \(  N_1 = \ad{1} a_1 \) and \( N_2 = \ad{2} a_2 \).
In terms of the previously defined operators, the Hamiltonian of the isotropic
double harmonic oscillator is given by
\[
  H_0 = \hbar \omega_0 \left(\ad{1} a_1 + \frac{1}{2} I + \ad{2} a_2 + \frac{1}{2} I\right)
      = \hbar \omega_0 \left(N_1 + N_2 + I\right)
\]
and its eigenstates are given by
\[
  H_0 \ket{n_1, n_2} = \hbar \omega_0 \left( n_1 + n_2 + 1 \right) \ket{n_1, n_2}
\]

Since \(n_1 + n_2 = n\) can be obtained in \(\sum_{i=0}^n i = \frac{1}{2}\,n(n+1)\) ways,
the energy levels of the isotropic double harmonic oscillator are \(\frac{1}{2}\,n(n+1)\) fold
degenerated.

In the fundamental state \(\ket{0, 0}\), with \(n_1=n_2=0\), the two dimensional
oscillator has a \emph{zero point motion} with the energy equal to \(\hbar \omega_0\).
Since we are interested in the spacings between consecutive,
we can rescale the energy such that the energy of the fundamental state becomes \(0\).
Thus the new Hamiltonian will be given by
\[
  H_0 = A \left(N_1 + N_2\right),
\]
where \(A = \hbar \omega_0\).

We can construct the basis starting from the vacuum state \(\ket{0, 0}\) by acting
with the creation operators
\begin{align*}
  {\ad{1}}^{n_1} \ket{0, 0} &= \sqrt{n_1!} \ket{n_1, 0} \\
  {\ad{2}}^{n_2} \ket{0, 0} &= \sqrt{n_2!} \ket{0, n_2}
\end{align*}

Thus, by applying the operator \({\ad{1}}^{n_1} {\ad{2}}^{n_2}\)
we generate
% such that \(n_1 + n_2 = n\)
% (in order to obtain for each \(n\) all the states with the
% energy \(n\, \hbar \omega_0\))
% we obtain
the basis elements ordered as follows:
\[
  \ket{0, 0} \ket{0, 1} \ket{0, 2} \cdots \ket{0, n} \ket{1, 0} \ket{1, 1}
  \cdots \ket{1, n - 1} \cdots \ket{i, 0} \ket{i, 1} \cdots \ket{i, n - i} \cdots
  \ket{n, 0}.
\]

For our investigations, the Hamiltonian is expressed as a function of the creation and annihilation
operators up to fourth order terms as follows

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:hamilt}
\begin{split}
  H &= A \left( \ad{1} a_1 + \ad{2} a_2 \right)
    + \frac{B}{4} \bigg[ \left( 3 \ad{1} {\ad{2}}^2 + 3 a_1 a_2^2
                               - {\ad{1}}^3 - a_1^3 \right)   \\
  &\quad + 3 \left( a_1 {\ad{2}}^2 + \ad{1} a_2^2 - \ad{1} a_1^2 - {\ad{1}}^2 a_1
             + 2 a_1 \ad{2} a_2 + 2 \ad{1} \ad{2} a_2
          \right) \bigg]  \\
  &\quad + \frac{D}{16} \bigg[ 6 \left( {\ad{1}}^2 a_1^2 + {\ad{2}}^2 a_2^2 \right)
                        + 2 \left( a_1^2 {\ad{2}}^2 + {\ad{1}}^2 a_2^2 \right)
                        + 8 \ad{1} a_1 \ad{2} a_2  \\
  &\quad + 4 \left(\ad{1} a_1^3 + {\ad{1}}^3 a_1 + \ad{2} a_2^3 + {\ad{2}}^3 a_2
     + a_1^2 \ad{2} a_2 + {\ad{1}}^2 \ad{2} a_2 + \ad{1} a_1 a_2^2 + \ad{1} a_1 {\ad{2}}^2
        \right)  \\
  &\quad + \left( {\ad{1}}^4 + a_1^4 + {\ad{2}}^4 + a_2^4
     + 2 {\ad{1}}^2 {\ad{2}}^2 + 2 a_1^2 a_2^2
      \right)
                        \bigg].
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The physical origin of this Hamiltonian is related to quadrupole dynamics of
nuclear surfaces\cite{Baran1998, Baran1996}.
The operators \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) are related to the normal modes of the
quadrupole vibrations. In the case of a deformed nucleus, one mode named \(\beta \)-vibration
corresponds to oscillations preserving the axial symmetry.
For the second mode, \(\gamma \)-vibrations,
the transversal section perpendicularly to the symmetry axis changes periodically
from ellipse to circle.

The energy levels will be expressed in units of harmonic oscillator energy and therefore
from here on we will consider \(A = 1\).
We can obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian by a
diagonalisation routine based on Relatively Robust Representations from
Intel\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Math Kernel Library~\cite{intel-mkl} used via a \texttt{Python}
program~\cite{NumPy-SciPy, scipy, matplotlib}%{\color{red} (+ citations)}.
Any such diagonalisation method requires a truncation of the Hilbert space
which induces errors concerning the eigenvalues. This errors increase as one moves to
the upper limit of the energy for a fixed dimension of the Hilbert space. Indeed we
expect this energies to have more important contributions from the states that were
eliminated by truncation.
We tested the stability of the energy levels by comparing the results obtained for
different sizes of the diagonalisation basis as is detailed in the next section.

\clearpage

\section{Stability}

We consider the \emph{stable levels} to be the eigenvalues which, at a change of
basis from one with a dimension of $N$ to one with dimension \(N+ \Delta N\),
do not change with more than a chosen threshold \(\delta_s\).
In the following figure we show the variation of the energy levels when
the dimension increases from \(N = 120\) to \(N = 140\).

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{"B0.2 D0.4 N120/bar_E_diff"}
  \captionof{figure}{\(B = 0.2, D = 0.4, N = 120\)}
\end{center}

We can observe that the first 400--600 eigenvalues have a very good stability.
Thus we can choose the stability threshold for example at \(\delta_s = 10^{-9}\).
Qualitatively the shape of this distribution does not depend on the parameters of
the Hamiltonian or the dimension of the Hilbert space because it reflects the nature
of the approximation as discussed previously.
For example, for \(B = 0.55, D = 0.4, N = 260\) compared
with \(N = 280\)

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{"B0.55 D0.4 N260/bar_E_diff"}
  \captionof{figure}{\(B = 0.55, D = 0.4, N = 260\)}
\end{center}

As expected, the number of stable levels increases with the
diagonalisation basis.
Roughly, for a given basis size $N$, the first 7--8\% levels differ with less
than \({\delta_s = 10^{-9}}\) when we compare with a basis of dimension
\(N + \Delta N\), with \(\Delta N = 20\).

\section{Statistics}

As mentioned in \cref{chap:quantum-chaos}, a spectrum can be characterised through the
probability distribution of the nearest neighbour spacing.
The \emph{spacing} is defined as the difference between two consecutive
energy levels. Similarly the \emph{relative spacing} is defined as
\[
  s = \frac{E_{i+1} - E_i}{\mean{\Delta E}},
\]
where \(\mean{\Delta E}\) is the average spacing \(\frac{E_n - E_0}{N}\).

The \emph{nearest neighbour spacing distributions} tell us the probability \(P(s)\dd{s}\) to
find a relative spacing $s$ when we move in the spectrum obtained by diagonalisation.
This probability is defined as follows
\[
  P(s)\dd{s} = \frac{N_{s,s+\Delta s}}{N},
\]
where \(N_{s,s+\Delta s}\) is the number of levels with the relative spacing
between \(s\) and \(s+ \Delta s\).
We can also define a \emph{cumulative probability distribution},
\[
  I(s) = \sum_{s_i=0}^s P(s_i) \Delta s
\]

\subsection{Irreducible representations}

In order to analyse the distributions of the previously obtained eigenvalues
we must first take into account the possible symmetries of the system.
A consistent analysis requires us to consider classes of states which transform
with the same \emph{irreducible representation}.

The Hamiltonian in eq.~\eqref{eq:hamilt} has the finite \(\mathcal{C}_{3v}\)
symmetry group.
This group has 3 irreducible representations: one bi-dimensional and
two unidimensional, one symmetric and one anti-symmetric, namely
\(\Gamma_b, \Gamma_s, \Gamma_a\).

\subsubsection{Separating the bi-dimensional representation}

The presence of the bi-dimensional representation corresponds a two-fold
degeneracy. These degeneracies can be identified  by scrutinising the
differences between consecutive levels \(\Delta E = E_{i+1} - E_i\).
An other option is to use directly the relative spacing, which is a rescaling
in units of average separation.
The separation of the symmetric and anti-symmetric irreducible representations
will be detailed later.

In figure~\ref{fig:bar_delta} we can see how \(\Delta E\) varies with the index of the
levels.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{"B0.2 D0.4 N60/bar_delta"}
  \caption{\(B=0.2, D=0.4, N=60\)}%
\label{fig:bar_delta}
\end{figure}

Due to of the finite precision of the numerical implementation, the
difference between two consecutive degenerate levels might not be exactly 0,
its value depending on the machine precision (as it can be seen in the above figure).
To take this fact into account we will consider that the levels which
have $s$ (or \(\Delta E\)) greater than a chosen \( \varepsilon \) as belonging
to one of the unidimensional representations.
In order to choose a suitable value for \( \varepsilon \), we use a histogram
to visualise the number of levels at different spacings
(see figure~\ref{fig:relsp-b0.2n120}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{"B0.2 D0.4 N120/hist_relsp"}
    \caption{\(B=0.2, D=0.4, N=120\)}%
    \label{fig:relsp-b0.2n120}  % chktex 24

  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{"B0.4 D0.4 N260/hist_relsp"}
    \caption{\(B=0.4, D=0.4, N=260\)}%
    \label{fig:relsp-b0.4n260}  % chktex 24
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{The relative spacing histograms for different parameters}
\end{figure}

This bimodal shape of the histogram suggests clearly the presence of the degenerate
levels well separated from the rest.
For some particular values for $B$ (such as \(B = 0.4\)) and high values for
$N$ (\( N > 200 \)), we observed a splitting of the block corresponding to
the degenerated levels in two blocks, namely one at exactly 0 and the other at
very low values. (see~\cref{fig:relsp-b0.4n260})

If we plot the spacing as a function of the level index, we can see how
each level is situated with respect to the chosen \( \varepsilon \).
Once again we can observe a clear separation of the spacings corresponding to
the bi-dimensional representation (see~\cref{fig:relsp}).

  \caption{\(B=0.2, D=0.4, N=60\)}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Separating the unidimensional representations}

The unidimensional representations can be distinguished from the properties
of the states at reflections with respect to the \(Ox\) axis
(\(y \rightleftarrows -y\)).
We ca establish a correspondence between the symmetry of the states to
this operation and the values of the quantum number \(n_2\). The states
containing dominantly oscillator ket vectors with even \(n_2\) will
transform with the symmetric representation.

The values of the quantum numbers \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) depend on the ordering of the basis.
Because the diagonalisation algorithm returns the eigenvalues
(and the corresponding eigenvectors) in ascending order,
the initial ordering of the basis is lost.
One method to approximate \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) for a given eigenvector would be
to consider that their values are given by the index of the dominant coefficient.
Thus, if we have the following eigenvector
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
    C_{0,0} \\ C_{0,1} \\ \vdots \\ C_{0,n} \\ C_{1,0} \\ \vdots \\ C_{1,n-1} \\
    \vdots \\ C_{i,0} \\ \vdots \\ C_{i,n-i} \\ \vdots \\ C_{n,0}
  \end{pmatrix}
\]
and \(C_{i,j}\) is the greatest coefficient, than we assign to this eigenvector
the quantum numbers of the \(k\)-th element in the basis, where \(k\) is the
index of the coefficient.

For example, for the simplified case of the isotropic double harmonic oscillator \
(\(B=D=0\)) with \(N=3\), the Hamiltonian is given by
\[
H=
\begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
  0 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0\\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2\\
\end{pmatrix}
\]
The eigenvalues will be \(E_i = 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2\) with the corresponding
eigenvectors
\[
  v_1 =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0
  \end{pmatrix},\
  v_{2} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0
  \end{pmatrix},\
  v_{3} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0
  \end{pmatrix},\
  v_{4} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0
  \end{pmatrix},\
  v_{5} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1
  \end{pmatrix},\
  v_{6} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0
  \end{pmatrix}
\]

Since the basis is given by
\[
  \ket{0, 0} \ket{0, 1} \ket{0, 2} \ket{1, 0} \ket{1, 1} \ket{2, 0},
\]
the quantum numbers for the eigenvectors will be assigned as follows
\begin{align*}
  v_1 &\equiv \ket{0, 0} \text{since}\ k = 1 \\
  v_2 &\equiv \ket{0, 1} \text{since}\ k = 2 \\
  v_3 &\equiv \ket{1, 0} \text{since}\ k = 4 \\
  v_4 &\equiv \ket{0, 2} \text{since}\ k = 3 \\
  v_5 &\equiv \ket{2, 0} \text{since}\ k = 6 \\
  v_6 &\equiv \ket{1, 1} \text{since}\ k = 5
\end{align*}

In figures~\ref{fig:bar-rep-b0.2n120} and~\ref{fig:hist-rep-b0.2n120},
respectively~\ref{fig:bar-rep-b0.63n260} and~\ref{fig:hist-rep-b0.63n260}
we can see the relative spacing for each irreducible representation as a function
of index and as a histogram for \(B=0.2\) and \(B=0.63\).
Once the problem of selection of the states corresponding to a given
irreducible representation was solved, we calculated the average spacing for
different values of $B$ (see~\cref{fig:avgsp}).

\subsection{Nearest neighbour distributions}

Having separated the states with respect irreducible representations we can also build
the nearest neighbour distributions. These histograms show the probability
of having a given spacing between consecutive levels as a function of $s$.

\Cref{fig:P(s)-b0.2n120,fig:I(s)-b0.2n120,fig:P(s)-b0.63n260,fig:I(s)-b0.63n260}
show the nearest spacing distributions \(P(s)\) and the cumulative
distributions \(I(s)\) for \(B=0.2\) and \(B=0.63\).

Taking into account the Berry-Tabor and Bohigas-Gianoni-Schmit conjectures,
we compare \(P(s)\) with the Poisson distribution \(P_P(s) = \ee^{-s}\)
and the Wigner distribution \(P_W(s) = \frac{\pi}{2} s \exp(-\frac{\pi}{4}s^2)\).

Since \(P(s)\) is a histogram, for an easier comparisom, we also computed the
histograms associated with the two distributions for the same spacing.
